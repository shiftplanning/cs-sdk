ShiftPlanning C# SDK
================

The [ShiftPlanning API](http://www.humanity.com/api/) allows you to call modules within the ShiftPlanning [employee scheduling software](http://www.humanity.com/) that respond in REST style JSON & XML.

This repository contains the open source C# SDK that allows you to utilize the above API in your applications. Except as otherwise noted, the ShiftPlanning C# SDK is licensed under the Apache Licence, Version 2.0 http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)


Usage
-----

The [examples][examples] are a good place to start. The minimal you'll need to
have is:

	 //initialize SDK where 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' = API Key
         shiftPlanning = new ShiftPlanning("XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX");


Logged in vs Logged out:

	if (shiftPlanning.getLoginStatus())
	{
		//LOGGED IN

	}
	else
	{
		//LOGGED OUT

	}


To make [API][API] calls:

	// call to update wages of employee 101

	//preparing list of request fields
	RequestFields employee_data = new RequestFields();
	employee_data.Add("id", 101);
	employee_data.Add("wage", 25);

	response = shiftPlanning.updateEmployee(employee_data);
	if (response.Status.Code == "1")
	{
		// Success
	}

####Adding SDK to a new project

If you create a new project, you need to add the following files

* APIRequest.cs
* APIResponse.cs
* DataFields.cs
* RequestFields.cs
* ShiftPlanning.cs

from ShiftPlanning C# SDK into your project. (Right click on the project, Add, Existing itemâ€¦, select files, and Add As Link)

With sources imported you will be able to easily debug, add your own methods in ShiftPlanning.cs, or to change existing if you need.
